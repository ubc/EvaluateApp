# Possible Future Improvements

## LTI Integration
As this platform reached version 1.0.0, the LTI integration feature was stripped out. This was a major simplification move, however there might be a good basis for including it.

A future improvement could examine this and add it if appropriate.

These NodeJS modules would be invaluable in implementing LTI Integration

## Pre-Written Clients
Implementing a client for the Evaluate Server is quite easy. A simple wrapper could be developed for various languages, and included in the repository.

We already have a good example of a php client here with the [Evaluate Wordpress Plugin](https://github.com/ubc/EvaluatePlugin/blob/master/includes/class-evaluate-connector.php).

Further details about how to implement a client can be found in the [Client Developer Documentation](./Developers.md)
